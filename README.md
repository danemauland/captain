This project was built using AWS Amplify. Install and set up the AWS Amplify cli following [these instructions](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/)

After setting up the Amplify CLI, run the commands "npm install" and "amplify push" which will set up the backend resources in the AWS account that you linked. Then, you can run "npm run start" to run the front-end locally, or "npm publish" to deploy the full stack to AWS.
